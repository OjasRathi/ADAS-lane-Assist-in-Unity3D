# ADAS-lane-Assist-in-Unity3D
Developed an ADAS Lane Assist module using Unity 3D and Python OpenCV. The project simulates real-time lane detection and steering offset estimation through perspective transformation, HSV thresholding, and sliding window algorithms, forming a base for autonomous lane-keeping systems.
